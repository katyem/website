<h1>The Plan</h1>

In essence, I want to build an online open-source platform that will allow researchers to create tests using R or Python code for image creation. Researchers will have access to open-source code (php and javascript) via GitHub that they can use on their own servers. The current vision is to use a matrix paradigm like the Raven's where the number of rows and columns vary depending on the design - not unlike my KOTA which has just one row and four columns. Researchers also will have access to code repositories for image creation. BTW, images can contain text/numbers which allow for the use of verbal and math-based items. Item images are built using automated item generation. Depending on the application, items could be created on the fly or called from a file system. 

Why? Researchers have few quality options when it comes to assessing cognitive abilities due to the proprietary nature of most tests. In addition, the concerns around test security and potential practice effects prevent open approaches to assessing psychological constructs. This type of AIG approach allows and encourages people to practice the test. Also, I'm still testing the hypothesis that practice can help to reduce error (theoretically, shrink the standard error) and that some portion of that error is due to racial discrimnation.

Dream list: A team of PHP/Javascript programmers with SQL and GitHub expertise. A project manager with GitHub expertise!! At least two Ph.D.-level I/O psychologists with expertise in psychometrics. 

Grant potential?

<h2>The Prototype</h2>

Progress has been slow this summer!! I initially thought I could use much of the code from the KOTA project but that isn't going to happen. I'm now slogging through writing the fundamental structure of the system.
