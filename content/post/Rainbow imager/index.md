Worked on a color version of the smaig stacks in order to test using them in calculating oclussion on a cube-by-cube basis. This required taking away the 3D effect on the surface in order to only count 1 color per cube. So, I added several new functions to the smaig_v2 function library in order to accomplish what was needed in Imager. The animation was made in R to demonstrate how the stacks are put together using cubes and then rotated on each axis. I had to zoom in at the end due to using the axes in the image - rgl automatically zooms out to accomodate whatever is in the image.
