Woo hoo!  Congratulations Doctors! 

They all now understand my mantra ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not over just because you successfully defended.‚Äù University red tape at its finest. 

A heartwarming event, especially having the opportunity to hood three of my former RAs (Olivia, Vinay, and Derrick).
Olivia‚Äôs dissertation looked at real-world example of organizational decision-making through the lens of statistical analysis using confidence intervals. It‚Äôs an interesting take on considering risks associated with decisions based on organizational data.

Both Derrick and Vinay did pioneering research in the assessment of cognitive abilities. As is the case of most pioneers, there were some major obstacles and tribulations. Derrick looked to see if there was evidence that practice on the KOTA would lead to less discrimination in a selection scenario. While Vinay examined the feasibility of using occlusion in a Shepard-Metzler test.  Neither obtained statistical evidence to support their hypotheses. Looking at the data from both studies, there were a large number of rapid test-takers in their samples. Vinay used an online source (MTurk) and Derrick used a mixed snowball-sample of participants recruited via social media and participants from an online source (MTurk). I hope to test my theory that online samples are not a good idea for assessing cognitive ability once COVID settles down. Until then, I‚Äôll continue to slog onward with developing the OAIG project.
