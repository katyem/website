[Dr. Vinay Patel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinpatel24/) completed a study (congratulations!!) which examined his idea that occlusion could be an item radical in SMMRT using a sample from [Prolific.com](https://prolific.com) that resulted in some pretty messy data. The primary issue was that many of the subjects completed the test way too fast - just my opinion which happens to be true. In the end, he did not find much in the way of support for using occlusion as a radical (an item feature related to difficulty). That said, we still believe his idea of using occlusion has merit and hope to continue data collection with an in-person sample. 

I'll update this with a link to his study once he provides one (nudge).
